# BrainBuddy is a smart and interactive chatbot designed to provide a personalized user experience with advanced math-solving capabilities. The chatbot is developed #to understand natural language queries, solve mathematical expressions, and remember user-specific information.
#In this project, I developed an interactive math chatbot called BrainBuddy using Python. I handled the entire logic behind how the bot solves math problems, tracks user progress, and gives personalized feedback. I used libraries like SymPy and math for calculations, and also focused on making the chatbot engaging by including emotional responses and topic suggestions. The idea was to create a learning assistant that feels fun, friendly, and helpful â€” kind of like a smart math buddy for students
